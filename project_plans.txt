Things to build or do:
	Upgrade the data processor:
		improve efficiency, fix sleep calculator,
		and add machine learning component.

	Create a universal login system for patients, nurses, and familial caregivers:
		Make it website oriented. Employ a circle of care, where one patient 
		may be granted different levels of access based on their status. Integrate with
		question and answer machine such that patient access is easy and the system can 
		tell who is being referenced based on unique, or general identifiers ('ma', 'pa', 'Barry', 'Ms. Finnegan'...).
	
	Create an app to use the current system or integrate with existing app to ensure widespread availability
		Make it usable with the QandA server and the general back end system.

	Make QandA server more robust, less prone to system failure, auto restartable, and system independant

	Perform a security overview of back end system and patient system to ensure confidentiality and security.

	Possibly migrate from amazon services to similar WSU services to ensure maintainability and cost 

	Create meta analysis engine for analyzing database trends or spotting patterns or changes within user data.
